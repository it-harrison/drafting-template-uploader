# drafting-template-uploader

## Purpose
This Drafting Template Uploader is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app that reads a `csv` file generated by the DraftingTemplate and uses its contents to create issues in the appropriate Github repo.

## Development
To make changes to the app:
* make sure you have `node v 18+` installed
* clone repo then `npm install`
* when finished run `npm make` and find an executable/binary in the `out` folder.
* an executable must be generated for each OS/Arch combo. Currently this is: Intel-Mac, Arm-Mac, Windows-x86.

## Code Overview
* `src/upload` - contains code related to parsing `csv` and making GH requests. Runs on back-end
* `src/index` - sets up the app in the backend / listens for events from frontend
* `src/preload` - listens for events from backend / sets up frontend api
* `src/renderer` - sets up listeners
* `src/handleToken` - encrypt GH token
* `src/index.html` - the markup for the app
* `src/index.css` - the styling for the app
