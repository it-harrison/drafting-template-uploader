# drafting-template-uploader

## Purpose
This Drafting Template Uploader is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app that reads a `csv` file generated by the DraftingTemplate and uses its contents to create issues in the appropriate Github repo.

## Generate an executable
* make sure you have `node v 18+` installed
* make sure you have `yarn` installed: `npm install --global yarn`
* clone repo then `yarn install`
* when finished run `npm run make` and find an executable/binary in the `out` folder.
  * on Mac the path is: `src/out/make/zip/darwin/x64/drafting-template-uploader-darwin-x64-1.0.0.zip`  (unzip the folder and the application is of type Application)
  * on Windows the path is: `src/out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/drafting-template-uploader-1.0.0 Setup.exe`
* an executable must be generated for each OS/Arch combo. Currently this is: Intel-Mac, Arm-Mac, Windows-x86.
